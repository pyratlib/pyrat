PyRat is a user friendly library in python to analyze data from the DeepLabCut. Developed to help researchers unfamiliar with programming can perform animal behavior analysis more simpler.

# Installation
------------

The latest stable release is available on PyPI, and you can install it by saying
```
pip install pyrat
```
Anaconda users can install using ``conda-forge``:
```
conda install -c conda-forge pyrat
```

To build PyRat from source, say `python setup.py build`.
Then, to install PyRat, say `python setup.py install`.
If all went well, you should be able to execute the demo scripts under `examples/`
(OS X users should follow the installation guide given below).

Alternatively, you can download or clone the repository and use `pip` to handle dependencies:

```
unzip pyrat.zip
pip install -e pyrat
```
or
```
git clone https://github.com/pyratlib/pyrat.git
pip install -e pyrat
```

By calling `pip list` you should see `pyrat` now as an installed package:
```
pyrat (0.x.x, /path/to/pyrat)
```
